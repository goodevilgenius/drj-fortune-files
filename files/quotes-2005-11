THANKSGIVING
I am thankful for:...the mess to clean after a party because it  means I
have been surrounded by friends....The taxes I  pay because it means
that I'm employed....The clothes that fit a little too snug because it
means I have enought to eat....My shadow who watches me work because it
means I am out in the sunshine....A lawn that needs mowing, windows that
need cleaning and gutters that need fixing becuase it means I have a
home....All the complaining I hear about our government because it means
we have freedom of speech....The spot I find at the far end of the
parking lot because it means I am capable of walking....My huge heating
bill because it means I am warm....The lady behind me in church who
sings off key because it means that I can hear....The piles of laundry
and ironing because it means  my loved ones  are nearby....Weariness and
aching muscles at the end of the day because it means I have been
productive....The alarm that goes off in the early morning hours because
it means that I'm alive.
