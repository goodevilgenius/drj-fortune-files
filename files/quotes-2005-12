Christmas is a time in which to remember Christ. It is a day in which to 
fortify our faith and draw near to the Father of the Babe of Bethlehem.  
He lives for us that we might live; he died for us that we may sometime 
escape the bonds of sin.

keener for the service that is prompted by the heart. All the petty 
thoughts seem to vanish for a while, and the true reward he's seeking is 
the glory of a smile. Then for others he is toiling and somehow it seems 
to me that at Christmas he is almost what God wanted him to be.
