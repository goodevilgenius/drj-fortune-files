It is wonderful to know that our Heavenly Father loves us--even with all our flaws! His love is such that even should we give up on ourselves, He never will.

We see ourselves in terms of yesterday and today. Our Heavenly Father sees us in terms of forever. Although we might settle for less, Heavenly Father won't, for He sees us as the glorious beings we are capable of becoming.

When Jesus gave His disciples a new commandment to "love one another; as I have loved you," He gave to them the grand key to happiness in this life and glory in the next.

Love is the greatest of all the commandments--all others hang upon it. It is our focus as followers of the living Christ.  It is the one trait that, if developed, will most improve our lives.

The past is behind--we must learn from it. The future is ahead--we must prepare for it. The present is now—we must live in it.

[An important] dimension of a broken heart [is] our deep gratitude for Christ's suffering on our behalf. In Gethsemane, the Savior "descended below all things" as He bore the burden of sin for every human being. At Golgotha, He "poured out his soul unto death," and His great heart literally broke with an all encompassing love for the children of God.  When we remember the Savior and His suffering, our hearts too will break in gratitude for the Anointed One.

As we make the sacrifice to Him of all that we have and all that we are, the Lord will fill our hearts with peace. He will "bind up the brokenhearted" and grace our lives with the love of God, "sweet above all that is sweet, . . . and pure above all that is pure."

Think about your life and set your priorities. Find some quiet time regularly to think deeply about where you are going and what you will need to do to get there. Jesus, our exemplar, often "withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed." We need to do the same thing occasionally to rejuvenate ourselves spiritually as the Savior did.  Write down the tasks you would like to accomplish each day. Keep foremost in mind the sacred covenants you have made with the Lord as you write down your daily schedules.

In this age of one hour dry cleaning and one minute fast food franchises, it may at times seem to us as though a loving Heavenly Father has misplaced our precious promises or He has put them on hold or filed them under the wrong name. . . .

When heaven's promises sometimes seem afar off, I pray that each of us will embrace these exceeding great and precious promises and never let go. . . . God will remember you.

The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of transformation. It takes us as men and women of the earth and refines us into men and women for the eternities.

The means of this refinement is our Christlike love. There is no pain it cannot soften, no bitterness it cannot remove, no hatred it cannot alter. The Greek playwright Sophocles wrote: "One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love."

The most cherished and sacred moments of our lives are those filled with the spirit of love. The greater the measure of our love, the greater is our joy. In the end, the development of such love is the true measure of success in life.

Jesus was also a being of flesh and spirit, but He yielded not to temptation see Mosiah 15:5. We can turn to Him as we seek unity and peace within, because He understands.  He understands the struggle, and He also understands how to win the struggle….Most importantly, may we look to Jesus to help restore the inner unity of our soul when we have succumbed to sin and destroyed our peace.
