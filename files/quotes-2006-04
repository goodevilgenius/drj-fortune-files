holds all the keys. As children of the Lord we should strive every day
to rise to
a higher level of personal righteousness in all our actions. We need to
guard constantly against all of Satan's influences.

"About one hour before my wife died, I called my children into her
room and told them that their mother was dying and for them to bid her
good-bye. One of the little girls, about twelve years of age, said to me:
'Papa, I do not want my mamma to die. I have been with you in the hospital
in San Francisco for six months; time and time again when mamma was in
distress you [have] administered to her and she has been relieved of her
pain and quietly gone to sleep. I want you to lay hands upon my mamma
and heal her.'

"I told my little girl that we all had to die sometime, and that I felt
assured in my heart that her mother's time had arrived. She and the rest
of the children left the room.

"I then knelt down by the bed of my wife (who by this time had lost
consciousness) and I told the Lord I acknowledged His hand in life,
in death, in joy, in sorrow, in prosperity, or adversity. I thanked Him
for the knowledge I had that my wife belonged to me for all eternity,
that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored, that I knew that
by the power and authority of the Priesthood here on the earth that I
could and would have my wife forever if I were only faithful as she had
been. But I told the Lord that I lacked the strength to have my wife die
and to have it affect the faith of my little children in the ordinances
of the gospel of Jesus Christ; and I supplicated the Lord with all the
strength that I possessed, that He would give to that little girl of mine
a knowledge that it was His mind and His will that her mamma should die.

"Within an hour my wife passed away, and I called the children back
into the room. My little boy about five and a half or six years of age
was weeping bitterly, and the little girl twelve years of age took him
in her arms and said: 'Do not weep, do not cry, Heber; since we went
out of this room the voice of the Lord from heaven has said to me,
"In the death of your mamma the will of the Lord shall be done." '

"Tell me, my friends, that I do not know that God hears and answers
prayers! Tell me that I do not know that in the hour of adversity the
Latter-day Saints are comforted and blessed and consoled as no other
people are!"
