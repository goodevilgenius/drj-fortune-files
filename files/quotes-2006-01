Set your goals--without goals you can't measure your progress.  But
don't become frustrated if the victories don't come quickly or easily.
Remind yourself that striving can be more important than arriving.  If
yor are striving for excellence--if you are trying your best day by day
with the wisest use of your time and energy to reach realistic
goals--you are a success, and you can feel proud of you accomplishments.

Each of us brings to the world unique talents, gifts and abilities.
Even if you don't know what it is, or value what you do, someone,
somewhere, will benefit from your presence.  No one can do what you do
exactly the way you do it.  It is the uniqueness that makes you valuable
to the world.  We are each as unique and valuable as the other.  It was
designed that way.  A gift from God.  Gifts are not given on the basis
of race or gender.  As a matter of truth, gifts come in many shapes,
sizes and colors.  When you do what you do, exactly the way you do it,
you are sharing God's gifts, bestowed for the good of the world.

I do not believe that any man lives up to his ideals, but if we are
striving, if we are working, if we are trying, to the best of our
ability, to improve day by day, then we are in the line of our duty. If
we are seeking to remedy our own defects, if we are so living that we
can ask God for light, for knowledge, for intelligence, and above all,
for his spirit, that we may overcome our weaknesses, then, I can tell
you, we are in the straight and narrow path that leads to life eternal.
Then we need have no fear.
     -- Heber J. Grant
